Future Improvements::
Backend Integration:
Connect to a backend service (e.g., Node.js/Express with MongoDB or Firebase) for multi-user functionality.
User Authentication:
Implement sign-up/login with JWT-based authentication.
Real-Time Collaboration:
Use WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) for real-time updates when multiple users work on the same board.
Custom Categories:
Allow users to create custom columns/categories dynamically.
Task Due Dates:
Add support for task deadlines and notifications/reminders.
Dark Mode:
Include a toggle for light/dark mode to enhance the user experience.
Accessibility Enhancements:
Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
Unit and Integration Testing:
Use Jest and React Testing Library to ensure app reliability.
Task Analytics:
Provide insights like the number of completed tasks, time spent on each stage, etc.
